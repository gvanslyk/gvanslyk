Iâ€™m @gvanslyk.
I am an Engineering Manager, and systems engineer with experience in embedded hardware, software development, sensor design, and systems.  Most of my past work has been related to embedded sensor design and software for underwater acoustic systems.  

My first job after earning my degree was with computer vision systemys using a beta version of OpenCV.  
I have recently found a renewed hobby interest in AI vision systems and robotics.
